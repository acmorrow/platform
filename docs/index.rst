Overview
========

MNMLSTC Platform is a small C++11 header library intended to provide a set of
C preprocessor defines as well as type traits to allow a developer to determine
the current platform, architecture, endianess, and operating system they are
compiling for. It is nearly equivalent to the Boost.Predef library, but is
neither compatible, nor is it a 1 : 1 header version of the
`predef wiki <http://predef.sf.net>`_.

It is recommended that new users read the section on
:ref:`using-mnmlstc-platform`. The documentation is ordered according to the
different component categories.
